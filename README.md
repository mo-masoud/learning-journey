# Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured path from mid-level to senior engineer.  
It contains exercises, implementations, and summaries focused on two areas:

- **Computer Science**: Algorithms, data structures, complexity analysis
- **Modern Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, SQL, and related technologies
- **Mini Projects**: Small projects from books and courses
- **Summaries**: Notes and key takeaways from books and courses
